                <h2>You Should Be Farming: Fundamental Deadlock Strategy</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    MOBAs can be a difficult genre to get acquainted with in the beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main reasons I think this is because beginner players aren't often given the fundamental <em>truths</em>
                    behind how these games operate. It's very easy to find guides about how to improve at a specific character, or even how
                    to begin understanding more advanced game concepts. But, maybe of these guides fail to understand that beginner MOBA
                    players often don't understand the primary, <em>fundamental underpinning</em> of the genre as a whole, and how their
                    actions in game should contrinbute towards it. Getting better at your character won't help you improve very much when
                    you don't even understand <em>what it is you're supposed to be doing, and why.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want this article to highlight what this fundamental underpinning actually is, and I'm going to do it through the lens
                    of Valve's new MOBA third person shooter, Deadlock. This concept will apply, however, to <em>any MOBA,</em> because the
                    thing I want to illustrate is fundamental to how the entire genre functions.
                </p>

                <h2>The Fundamental Truth: YOU SHOULD BE FARMING</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    YOU SHOULD BE FARMING.
                </p>
                <p>
                    YOU SHOULD BE FARMING.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, now that I've said that a few times, let's get into what that means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a MOBA, you are essentially playing an RPG versus another human being. In this RPG, your goal is to level yourself up,
                    acquire skills and items and levels, and then win the game by using the power that you've acquired to overwhelm the enemy
                    team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to reiterate this point, and stress how fundamental it is to understand. <em>You are playing an RPG. Your goal
                    is to level yourself up.</em> I don't think people understand what the ramifications of this statement actually mean, and
                    I'm going to spend the rest of this article attempting to drill down into it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is not about killing players.<br/>
                    The game is not about taking towers, or other map objectives.<br/>
                    The game is not even about pushing into the enemy base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>The game is about leveling yourself up by farming EXP.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, once you've leveled yourself up, you are then granted the ABILITY to do these other things. Being higher
                    level than an enemy player allows you to kill them. It allows you to push towards map objectives. It allows you to push
                    into their base. But, no matter what, DO NOT FORGET THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE. The objective is to <em>get stronger.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's very easy to lose sight of this primary objective, and start doing other things. However, you must always return to
                    this fundamental truth. The goal of the game, the primary game action that you must always be participating in, is to
                    <em>farm EXP, and use that EXP to become stronger than the opponent.</em> You're going to see me say this over, and over,
                    and over again, because <em>I need you to understand how important it is.</em> If you allow yourself to get lost in other
                    side objectives, you will find yourself out-leveled, and you will lose the game because of it.
