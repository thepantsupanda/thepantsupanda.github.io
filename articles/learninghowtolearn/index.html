            <h2>Learning How To Learn</h2>
            <hr>

                Before you read anything else in this article, I think it's important that you know a few things about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing you should know is that I write a lot. I have a lot of thoughts. I'm sure you can see that,
                but I encourage you to read.

                I have ADHD, and went undiagnosed for most of my life. When I was in school, I never really "studied" much
                of anything. I either understood it when it was explained in class (which was most of the time), or I didn't.
                I did my homework, got decent grades, and never really thought too hard about school. I was doing other things
                in my free time, like writing Minecraft mods in Java that never worked, jailbreaking my iPod touch, and replaying
                my favorite video game of all time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgCSgNakvlo" target="_blank">
                Kingdom Hearts 2</a>, for the 6th or 7th time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2014, I started college. The rigid structure of grade school was replaced with something a little more free-form,
                and I really struggled with it. In my second year, I was so depressed and burned out that I got kicked out of a class,
                and had to beg my instructor to let me back in. I had started smoking cigarettes. I was getting about 3 hours of sleep
                per night. It was not a good time for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this time, however, I was doing a bunch of cool stuff in my free time. I had hacked my Nintendo 3DS, and was
                writing small applications for it in C++. I was building a personal website (which was sadly lost forever when
                BitBalloon was taken over by Netlify). I was also playing what would become my second or third favorite video game
                of all time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2ZEj8JK2tY" target="_blank">Persona 4 Golden</a>, for the
                first time.
            </p>

                One of my biggest issues for many years was an inability to stick to learning something over a longer period of time.
                If there wasn't some structure in my life forcing me to commit to something, I've never been able to do it by my own
                free will. I just couldn't maintain interest long enough in order to see meaningful improvement. My life is full of
                unfinished projects encompassing many different creative fields, which has turned me into a "jack of all trades,
                master of none" type person. For a long time, I resented this, and it was very upsetting to me that I couldn't stick
                with things long enough to get <em>truly good</em> at them.

                Fast forward to 2020. During this time, COVID hit, I dropped out of college, got an IT job doing a multitude of tasks
                (check my <a href="../../2024Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>), and got my first apartment. It was also when I
                feel like I finally learned <em>HOW TO LEARN THINGS.</em> And, while programming at work definitely helped this,
                the thing that <em>REALLY</em> facilitated that discovery was <em>FIGHTING GAMES.</em>
            </p>
            <h2>The Fighting Game Experience</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                At the time, the only fighting game that I had ever really played was Super Smash Bros (yes, Smash is a fighting game,
                don't be weird about it please). I was pretty god awful at it, and I never felt like I could find any tutorials or
                guides on how to get better that <em>spoke to my brain.</em> Playing Smash was always a constant struggle with having
                no idea what was really going on, and not having a framework for understanding the strategy of the game conceptually.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I was living in my first apartment, however, a beta for
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhr9WpjaDzw" target="_blank">GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-</a> released, and me and my
                brother played it several times during the testing period. I was immediately impressed with how fun the game was,
                even with a limited understanding of it all. I thought about how cool it would be to genuinely <em>get into</em> Guilty
                Gear. Not to just play it here and there, but actually <em>commit myself</em> to it, in an effort to genuinely improve.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was desperately looking to prove to myself that I could commit to a thing long term and get <em>truly good</em> at it.
                I had multiple things to prove here. For one, I just liked the game and wanted to get good at it. I wanted to be better
                at fighting games in general after struggling with them for so long. Not only that, but I wanted to learn how a person
                commits to a thing long term, and how to learn skills in a way that was easier for my brain. And so, I took the plunge,
                and as soon as Strive released, I sat down with the full intention to <em>learn how to learn how to be good at
                Guilty Gear.</em>
